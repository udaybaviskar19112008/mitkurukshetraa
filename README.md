Job Seeker and Recruiter Platform
Overview

This platform is designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and recruiters. It allows job seekers to upload resumes, get evaluated for job positions, and get feedback on how to improve. Recruiters can also evaluate candidates through an innovative 3-round process:

Resume Upload & Evaluation: Candidates upload their resumes and get short-listed based on job relevance and skill match.

AI Bot Interview: AI bot conducts an interview and shortlists more candidates based on their responses.

Final Interview (Online/Offline): The recruiter conducts an interview, either online with end-to-end encryption or offline.

The platform also incorporates student verification, recruiter verification, and a chatbot to assist both candidates and recruiters throughout the process.

Features

Resume Evaluation:

Job seekers upload resumes for a specific job role.

The system compares the candidate's skills with the job requirements and shortlists candidates accordingly.

Feedback on areas of improvement and suggestions are provided to the candidates.

Aptitude Test:

After resume shortlisting, candidates take an aptitude test to further narrow down the pool.

AI Bot Interview:

The AI bot conducts a mock interview with the candidate, asking job-related questions.

Candidates are further shortlisted based on their interview responses.

Final Interview:

Recruiters conduct the final interview (online or offline).

End-to-End Encryption: For online interviews, secure video calls will be enabled.

Recruiter Verification:

Recruiters can register their companies. Small or new companies can also be verified manually by company heads.

Verification Process: A recruiter will provide a business or company document (or verify via LinkedIn) to prove legitimacy.

Student Verification:

Job seekers will go through a verification process where they prove their student status.

Verification can involve uploading a student ID or academic transcript.

Data Cleaning:

The platform will automatically clean resumes, suggesting corrections for common mistakes (e.g., spelling, grammar).

AI-Powered Chatbot:

Job Seeker Chatbot: Assists candidates with resume feedback, interview questions, and general queries.

Recruiter Chatbot: Helps recruiters manage the hiring process, answer queries, and access past history.

Feedback and Improvement Suggestions:

After each evaluation stage (resume, aptitude test, AI interview), feedback is provided to the job seeker.

Suggestions are provided on how to improve their chances for the next stage.

Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js for dynamic user interfaces.

Backend: Python with Flask for APIs.

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user and resume data.

AI & NLP:

Pre-trained models (like GPT, SpaCy) for resume evaluation, interview bots, and chatbot interactions.

Video Calls: WebRTC or Twilio for end-to-end encrypted video calls.

Resume Parsing: Open-source libraries like pyresparser or spacy for extracting key information from resumes.

Security: WebRTC (for encrypted communication) and HTTPS for all requests.

How It Works

Job Seekers:

Upload their resume for a specific job role.

The platform analyzes the resume, checks the relevance with job descriptions, and shortlists candidates based on a threshold.

Candidates take an aptitude test (second round).

AI Bot Interview: The bot conducts a simulated interview, and based on answers, further shortlists candidates.

Feedback and suggestions are provided to the candidates after each stage.

Recruiters:

Recruiters can verify their company by providing the required details or documents.

Once verified, recruiters can post job openings.

They can view and shortlist candidates who have passed the resume and AI bot interview rounds.

If the recruiter opts for an online interview, they will be provided with an encrypted video call solution.
